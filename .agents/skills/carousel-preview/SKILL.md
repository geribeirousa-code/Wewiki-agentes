# Carousel Preview Generator

Takes a carousel directory and stitches all slides into a single wide horizontal image with a dark background - ready to share on social media. If any slide has an animated MP4 version, it produces a video preview instead.

## Process

### Step 1: Find the Carousel

The user provides either:
- A full path: `workspace/2026-02-21/Claude Code Skills 101/`
- A carousel name: `Claude Code Skills 101`

If they give just a name, look in `workspace/<date>/<name>/`. Check recent dates if the exact date isn't specified.

### Step 2: Generate the Preview

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/carousel-preview/scripts/carousel_preview.py "workspace/<date>/<title>/"
```

**Options:**
- `--height N` - Target slide height in pixels (default: 600). Use 400 for a smaller preview, 800 for higher quality.
- `--output path.png` - Custom output path (default: `preview.png` in the carousel directory).
- `--exclude filename.png` - Exclude specific files from the preview.

### Step 3: Show the Result

Read the generated `preview.png` and display it to the user.

If any slides had MP4 versions, the script outputs `preview.mp4` (video) and `preview.png` (static first frame). Always display the `.png` preview - never try to read the `.mp4` directly.

If the user wants adjustments, re-run with different options:
- **Bigger/smaller:** Adjust `--height`
- **Different output location:** Use `--output`
